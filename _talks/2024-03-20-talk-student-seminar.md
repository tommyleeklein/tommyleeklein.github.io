This talk was given at a student seminar, organised by [Ran Azouri](https://ranazouri.com) and [Jordan Levin](https://sites.google.com/view/jordanlevin). The topic was cartesian fibrations of \\(\infty\\)-categories and Lurie's straightening / unstraightening equivalence. There are no slides available but I wrote down some [notes](https://github.com/tommyleeklein/tommyleeklein.github.io/blob/e61e043323aa4ee938c91f8f3f961cd33f665f1e/_talks/inftycat_talk_M2.pdf).
