This talk was given at a student seminar, organised by [Ran Azouri](https://ranazouri.com) and [Jordan Levin](https://sites.google.com/view/jordanlevin). The topic was cartesian fibrations of $\infty$-categories and Lurie's straightening / unstraightening equivalence. There are no slides available but I wrote down some [notes](/inftycat_talk_M2.pdf).
