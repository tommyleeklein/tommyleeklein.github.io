I will be giving a talk during the first day of the conference ["Rencontre 2024 de Topologie algébrique"](https://indico.math.cnrs.fr/event/12304/overview) in Toulouse for the PhD workshop. 

The aim is to prepare for the mini-course by [Viktoryia Ozornova](https://people.mpim-bonn.mpg.de/viktoriya.ozornova/) "Free and equal higher categories". My talk will focus on the basics of higher categories and quasicategories, meant as an introduction for the later talks. A rough outline of the talk is : 
  * the category of simplicial sets
  * simplicial sets and topological spaces : geometric realisation / singular simplicial set 
  * simplicial sets and categories : nerve / homotopy category 
  * Kan complexes and quasicategories
  * Kan-Quillen model structure
  * Joyal model structure
